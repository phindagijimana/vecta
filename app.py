STEP 1: Determine if this is epilepsy
- Analyze clinical presentation, seizure history, EEG findings
- If NOT epilepsy: State "Not Epilepsy" and stop
- If epilepsy: Continue to STEP 2

STEP 2: Classify seizure onset type (if sufficient evidence)
- FOCAL: Seizures originating from one brain region
  → If aware: Focal Aware Seizure
  → If impaired awareness: Focal Impaired Awareness Seizure
- GENERALIZED: Seizures affecting both hemispheres from onset
  → Motor: Tonic-clonic, Absence, Myoclonic, Atonic
  → Non-motor: Typical/Atypical Absence
- UNKNOWN: Insufficient evidence to determine onset
- COMBINED: Both focal and generalized seizures present

STEP 3: Specify seizure subtype (if sufficient evidence exists)
- For Focal: Motor vs Non-motor onset
- For Generalized: Specify exact type (tonic-clonic, absence, myoclonic, etc.)
- If evidence insufficient: Stop at onset level

MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT (4 bullet points, max 25 words each):
- Classification: [Epilepsy? If yes, seizure type and subtype based on evidence]
- Clinical_Confidence: [High/Medium/Low based on available evidence]
- Evidence: [Key clinical/EEG/imaging findings supporting classification]
- Medication_Analysis: [AED recommendations based on seizure type classified]

CRITICAL: Only classify to the level supported by evidence. If unsure, state limitation.`,

      classification: `MANDATORY FORMAT: Respond with exactly 4 bullet points, max 25 words each.

- Classification: [Your clinical reasoning for this classification task]
- Clinical_Confidence: [High/Medium/Low based on evidence]
- Evidence: [Key supporting evidence from provided data]
- Medication_Analysis: [Treatment recommendations with medical reasoning]

Apply your medical training for evidence-based classification.`,

      diagnosis: `MANDATORY FORMAT: Respond with exactly 4 bullet points, max 25 words each.

- Diagnosis Support: [Differential diagnosis and primary diagnosis reasoning]
- Clinical_Confidence: [High/Medium/Low based on clinical evidence]
- Evidence: [Key diagnostic findings from provided data]
- Medication_Analysis: [Treatment recommendations based on diagnosis]

Apply comprehensive diagnostic protocols for clinical analysis.`,

      summary: `MANDATORY FORMAT: Respond with exactly 4 bullet points, max 25 words each.

- Summarization: [Clinical summary with key findings]
- Clinical_Confidence: [High/Medium/Low based on documentation]
- Evidence: [Critical information from medical record]
- Medication_Analysis: [Medication-related summary and recommendations]

Apply clinical documentation standards for comprehensive summarization.`,

      extraction: `MANDATORY FORMAT: Respond with exactly 4 bullet points, max 25 words each.

- Information Extraction: [Key medical information identified]
- Clinical_Confidence: [High/Medium/Low based on data quality]
- Evidence: [Specific data points extracted from source]
- Medication_Analysis: [Medication information and recommendations]

Apply medical information extraction expertise using clinical standards.`
